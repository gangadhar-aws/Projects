#### Details about our Project
1. Setup Jenkins server 
we are using ubuntu VM and installing the jenkins using below commands
install Java
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
```
Check java version
then proceed for installing jenkins server
```sh
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```
2. Here we are following the modern day solutions to spinup and tiering down the docker container upon requirements. For testing same instance install the docker
```sh
sudo apt install docker.io
```
Docker typicall runs on docker demon process that's a single process. by default not accessble to other users. i have to grant access to docker demon to jenkins users. as well as ubuntu user 
```sh
sudo su -
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
```
create container to check docker running fine or not
```sh
docker run hello-world
```
"Any permission issue exit then add jenkins user to docker groop and login with su - jenkins and try again it should work"
hello-world very light weight image to check our docker service running or not

3. Install the docker pipe-line plugin to jenkins
    dashboard/managejenkins/plug-ins/
    - Docker Pipeline
    - restart the jenkins
4. Write the Jenkins file
